                    This foundation is committed to the rescue and rehabilitation of both wildlife and domestic animals in need. They respond to injured creatures, offering immediate treatment to alleviate their pain, whether itâ€™s a bird, animal, reptile, or amphibian. In addition to their rescue work, they run awareness programs at schools and colleges, educating people about the importance of nature and its creatures. The foundation also supports families caring for stray animals by distributing food and water containers, and they provide bird nests during the monsoon season to ensure the safety of the birds.
